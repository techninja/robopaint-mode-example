# Example Text Rendering RoboPaint Mode
An example RoboPaint mode that renders text, and is great for learning How to
make your own RoboPaint Mode!

This module is a mode for [RoboPaint](https://github.com/evil-mad/robopaint),
the software for drawing robots, and your
[friendly painting robot kit, the WaterColorBot](http://watercolorbot.com)!

This mode is meant to be as simple as possible, while still actually doing
something. This mode utilizes the Paper.JS automatic sizing canvas, the
HersheyText module, and the automatic settings form management for
saving/loading form values.

More documentation to come as the Mode API solidifies.
